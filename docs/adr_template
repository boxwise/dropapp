# ADR template by Michael Nygard

This is a template for architecture decisions based partly on [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
You can use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

In each ADR file, write these sections:


# Title

What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?

## Context or Problem Statement

## Decision Drivers 

What are the key criterias on which the decision is based.

## Considered Options

Which alternatives were considered?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
