# Authorization with Auth0

Trello-card: https://trello.com/c/kypUAjlw/747-vahid-will-create-adr-for-authentication-authorization-implementation-design

## Status

proposed

## Context or Problem Statement

DropApp currently uses embedded SQL queries to handle authorization. Right now, the system has a very granular access model for managing access to functionalities. 

## Decision Drivers 

1. Resource Types
2. Identity Types
3. Underlingâ€™s Protocols
4. Flexibility of Rules
5. Ease of Implementation
6. Security / Risk for us
7.  Ease of Use
8.  Cost

## Considered Options

- **Auth0 Core Authorization** (roles and permissions - rules)
- **Auth0 Extended Authorization** (roles, permissions and groups - rules)
- **Auth0 Organizations Authorization** (roles, permissions, organizations - rule)

## Discussion

The current system access control looks like this:
 - [x] Each *User* has belong to a *Role (User Group)*
 - [x] Each *Role* belong to  *Group (User Group Level)*
 - [x] Each *Role  (User Group)* contains 1 to Many *Resource / Permission (Function)* 
 - [x] Each *Role  (User Group)* has access to 1 to Many *Base (Camp)*
 - [x] Each *Organization* has a *Base (Camp)*
 - [x] Each *Base (Camp)* can access by 1 to Many *Role  (User Group)*
 - [x] Each *Base (Camp)* contains predefined *Resource / Permission (Function)* 

Using the above mentioned model, system admins can grant or revoke certain functions based on either **Role** or **Base**. Boxtribute is implementing a new stack and currently Authentication is backed by Auth0, so it is necessary to move Authorization into a reliable service.

*Auth0 core* supports simple *Role Based Access Control (RBAC)*, and for each tenant, Roles and Permissions can be assigned to Users. To migrate the current complex authorization system, we must simplify or flatten the Roles and Permissions in a way that maintains the previous access model.

In order to capture the requirements for this change, the following steps were taken:

 1. Permissions captured from **Database perspectives**. 
 2. Analyzing all requests in the DropApp application to find the exact requests and mapping them to permissions.

The summary of the permissions taken from the system is:

| Module |  Permissions| Required  Data Models |
|--|--| --|
| Beneficiary | *beneficiary:read* - *beneficiary:write* - *transactions:read* - *transaction:write* - *transaction:give* - *tags:read* | `people, transactions, people_tags`
| Inventory  | *qr:create* - *qr:read* - *stock:read* - *stock:write* - *products:read* - *locations:read* - *tags:read* - *product_categoris:read*| `locations, stock, qr, genders, sizes, products, product_categories`
| Free Shop  | *transcation:read* - *transcation:write* - *stock:read* - *products:read*, *beneficiary:read* | `transations, people, stock, products, product_categories`
| Insight  | *transactions:read* - *products:read*| `transations, products, product_categories`
| Admin  | *products:read* - *products:update* - *users:read* - *users:write* - *locations:read* - *locations:write*| `transations, people, stock, products, product_categories`
| Boxtribute God  | *organization:read* - *organization:write* - *bases:read* - *bases:write* | `organizations, camps`

## Example of Flattened Authorization based on Auth0:

 *Organization 10001* which has two bases in Europe named *Base X1* and *Base X2*. User with Admin and Coordinator roles can access *Base X1* , while only Coordinator should able to access Base X2. 

**Roles:**

- base_**x1** [this role used to customized the permissions for Base X1]
- base_**x2**
- coordinator
- admin

**Permissions:**

In order to give the system the flexibility to create various kind of roles which can be used for various organization and bases, we can create dynamic permissions. This mean all the bases that already created in the system will be added as permission to Auth0. For that, we can create permission as:

    'base_' + [base identifier]

This way we are able to grant or revoke access to any bases to a specific Role in our system. Further, we will create base as Role with the following pattern:

    'role_' + [system level roles: admin / coordinator / volunteer ]
    
This above mentioned role has created to restrict some specific permissions for a specific base. 

So considers the following roles:

- base_**x1**
- base_**x2**
- role_coordinator:*
- role_**admin**:*
- role_**volunteer**:*
 - users:read
 - users:write
 - beneficiaries:read 
	 *- The role contains this permission can have read access  to beneficiaries*
 - beneficiaries:write 
	 *- The role contains this permission can have write access to beneficiaries*

**Roles and Permissions Assignment:**

- base_**x1** <--- (role_admin:* , beneficiaries:read)
- base_**x2** <--- (role_admin:* , role_coordinator:*, beneficiaries:read, beneficiaries:write)
- admin <--- (beneficiaries:read, users:write)
- coordinator  <--- (beneficiaries:read, users:read)

**Assumptions:**

We considered to add organization_id and base_ids as part of JWT for all the users. This will reduce complexity of design for time being but we still need to keep our DB in sync with Auth0 user for any changes.

**Implementation:**

Auth0 by default includes all the **permissions** for the roles assigned to a user in permissions array inside **JWT**, but in order to add custom permissions according to the user assigned bases, we need to use Auth0 Rules (Actions - newly introduced) feature that acts as a middleware within token generation process. The following picture captured from Auth0 depicted the how Rules applies during the authentication.

Having base_ids in the Auth0 app meta data we can use that info to query permissions of the bases and finalized actual users permissions:

    function (user, context, callback) { 
	    var ManagementClient = require('auth0@2.9.1').ManagementClient; 
	    var management = new ManagementClient({ token: auth0.accessToken, domain: auth0.domain });
	    management.getUsers(function (err, users) { 
			console.log(users); callback(null, user, context);
	    }); 
	}

## Decision

Currently all request within a system handled by HTTP protocol
 
**Using Auth0 Core** 

## Consequences

### Easier:
Auth0 Core simplify the permissions and roles and still with Rule / Action some business rules can be defined as part of generation of JWT.
### More difficult:
Auth0 Organizational can be more fitted with the current group_id in use in legacy  system but its make our system so tied into Auth0 any change in their current model.
